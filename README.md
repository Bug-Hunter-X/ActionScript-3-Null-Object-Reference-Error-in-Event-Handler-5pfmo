This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 error: a null object reference in an event handler. The `bug.as` file contains code that throws this error, while `bugSolution.as` provides a corrected version with robust error handling.  The error arises from attempting to access a property of an object that is unexpectedly null. This frequently happens due to asynchronicity or improper event listener management. The solution emphasizes type checking and conditional statements to prevent the error.
